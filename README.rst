kenl380 Package Repository
==========================

This is the top level python package for the python packages that I have published on PyPI. It's function is basically to supply a namespace, so
that I don't conflict with other modules and packages.

---------------

To see an example of a submodule that would be installed within this namespace, take a look at ``pylib``, which you can find on GitHub `in this repository<https://github.com/kenlowrie/pylib>`_.
